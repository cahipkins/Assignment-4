      <p> At the time my son was 2 and had never been on a plane ride. We boarded at Philadelphia Airport and took a direct flight for 7 hours to California.
         My son did great. He was attentive and excited. He listened to music and watched movies until he feel asleep the rest of the ride. </p>
      <h2>CALIFORNIA LIVING</h2>

      <p>When we arrived in California we drove straight to our Air BNB in Anaheim, California and it was amazing. It was a mini mansion and it had a huge
         pool and hot tub which my son and I hopped right into within 20 mins of getting there.  </p>
      <h2>UNIVERSAL STUDIOS</h2>

      <p> Our first visit outside was Universal Studios and my son loved it. They had all kinds of jurassic park and dinosaur interactive games and rides
         he could utilize and he loved it. The Jurassic Park ride was my favorite. We got on it twice even though the lines were long. </p>
      <h2>A DAY IN HOLLYWOOD </h2>
      <img src = "./images/hollywood.jpeg" alt = "Hollywood sign">
      <p> The next day we spend in the hills of Hollywood and downtown LA. We drove up the hills and took pictures at the Hollywood sign and walked around 
         and looked at all the beautiful homes on the hills. We also went into downtown LA and walked the Hollywood blvd and ate great food at Santa Monica pier. </p>
      <h2> DISNEYLAND </h2>
